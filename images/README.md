## Project Vision

The Hill Farms Limited envisions to transform subsistence agriculture of smallholder farmers into a profitable and sustainable business. Hill Farms looks to inspire more youth to join agriculture as well. 

## Project Background 

Hill Farms Limited is a Rwanda based agriculture company of young professional agriculture enthusiasts who have seen opportunities in our most needed sector (Agriculture), not for own benefits only but for their communities and nature. With current revolution of green economy, and more agriculture food production as a basic urgent need but contributing massively climate change, African agriculture businesses as usual will not be viable and sustainable for our economy and nature. It is for deployment of agricultural best approaches and practices for smallholder poor farmers to increase their agriculture production, while sustainably benefiting our natural ecosystems that the Hill Farms Limited company was founded and became operational during the Covid-19 in May 2020.  
Rwanda has a small size of land available for agriculture production due to both total land size of the country and terrain landscape of the country. With therefore limited land resource, novel techniques and technologies are required for improve production while conserving our natural resources for future. The Hill Farms approach is socially inclusive encompassing nature, economy and social values for shared benefits and values.
