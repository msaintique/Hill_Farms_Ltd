                            <p>
                                Hill Farms Limited is a Rwanda based agriculture company of young professional agriculture
                                enthusiasts who have seen opportunities in our most needed sector (Agriculture), not for own benefits only but for their communities and nature.
                                With current revolution of green economy, and more agriculture food production as a basic urgent need but contributing massively climate change, African agriculture businesses as usual will not be viable and sustainable for our economy and nature.
                                It is for deployment of agricultural best approaches and practices for smallholder poor farmers to increase their agriculture production, while sustainably benefiting our natural ecosystems that the Hill Farms Limited company was founded and became operational during the Covid-19 in May 2020.  
                                Rwanda has a small size of land available for agriculture production due to both total land size of the country and terrain landscape of the country. With therefore limited land resource, novel techniques and technologies are required for improve production while conserving our natural resources for future. 
                                The Hill Farms approach is socially inclusive encompassing nature, economy and social values for shared benefits and values.

                                <br><br>The main goals of this business are to unlock potential of horticultural production of high demand for export, employing best farm practices to meet high end international market standards, to increase Rwanda staples’ productivity and profitability of the farms while ensuring sustainability for Rwanda’s horticultural industry. 
                                Hill Farms targets to produce high end health beneficial horticultural produce such as Chilli, Ginger and Turmeric, Chia Seeds etc. and to increase their acreage and productivity. For staples especially Maize and Potatoes, we target to increase productivity from current 1 or 2 tons per hectare to 4 or 5 tons per hectare for maize in the period of three years, as well as  for potatoes
